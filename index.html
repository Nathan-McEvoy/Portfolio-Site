                        <h2>Who is this guy?</h2>
                        <p>Nathan is a 2nd year BSc Computer Science student at the University of Hertfordshire<br>
                            His strengths lie in his critical thinking, problem solving and communication skills, while working under
                            pressure
                            either independently, or within a team.<br>
                            He has worked as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acting Head of IT for a marketing company</li>
                            <li>Emergency Ambulance Crew for the London Ambulance Service</li>
                            <li>Live-in carer for people with severe mobility issues (para|quadraplegic, ALS etc)</li>
                            <li>and several other roles with both the NHS and privately within the healthcare industry, totalling a decade
                                of
                                experience</li>
                        </ul>
                        He notes that although he has worked in and studied for varying roles and industries, at the heart of it, they have
                        all
                        revolved around solving problems within a timely manner, often within a team and almost always under intense
                        pressures.

                        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                        <p>From a young age, Nathan has been interested in technology, and how it could be used to better the lives of
                            others.<br>
                            He is most fascinated by the potential implications of Artificial Intelligence, particularly how it could (and
                            already is) benefit the lives of everyone but especially those that need the most help.<br>
                            AlphaFold - an AI program developed by DeepMind - is of particular interest, as it predicts with very high
                            levels of
                            accuracy the structures of complex proteins in 3D.
                            Quote from Forbes' website:</p>
                        <blockquote
                            cite="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2021/10/03/alphafold-is-the-most-important-achievement-in-ai-ever/">
                            "A protein's shape relates closely to its function. To take one example, antibody proteins fold into shapes that
                            enable
                            them to precisely identify and target particular foreign bodies, like a key fitting into a lock. Understanding
                            the
                            shape
                            that proteins will fold into is thus essential to understanding how organisms function, and ultimately how life
                            itself
                            works." (Rob Toews, 2021)

                        <h3>Virtual and Augmented Reality</h3>
                        <p>When Nathan isn't thinking about how to prevent Skynet from becoming reality, his attention shifts to alternate
                            realities instead.<br>
                            While the technology isn't quite able to bring epic adventures to life, such as experiencing the breeze and
                            ocean
                            spray aboard a 19th Century ship or feeling the heat from a roaring dragon, it is making steady progress.<br>
                            He states himself that in just a few short years and a lot of trial and error, the visual acuity and general
                            comfort
                            of the VR devices has improved dramatically - although he still suffers eye strain from extended sessions.<br>
                            Putting fantasy aside, both VR and AR (Augmented Reality - a branch of VR that overlaps computer imagery with
                            the
                            real world) have great potential to share ideas, help visualise thoughts, guide or control robots, and
                            collaborate
                            on 3D models in real-time.
                            He postulates that with advances in non-intrusive brain activity scanning, AI, and further VR/AR hardware
                            upgrades,
                            you will be able to manipulate the (simulated) world around you with just a thought, such that dreams become
                            reality.
